&nbsp;Hi Iâ€™m **Edward**, I am interested in applying mathematics and solving problems since from my school days. I was introduced to Data Anaylsis during my MBA and used SPSS then. I joined in current organization in Fraud Management team where my responsibilities are to find the suspicious patterns in data and to control the losses in the Telecom. The role piqued interest in me which made to learn more about Machine Learning techniques.

&nbsp;I struggled initially to learn coding and mathematical concepts. So, I created this blog to share my knowledge/journey towards Machine Learning.

&nbsp;**Interests:** Deep Learning and its implications
